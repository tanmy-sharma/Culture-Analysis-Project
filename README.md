Company culture analysis refers to the process of evaluating and understanding the shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and practices within an organization. It involves examining the overall environment, norms, and patterns of behavior that exist within a company. The purpose of company culture analysis is to gain insights into the organization's culture, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make informed decisions for improving or leveraging the culture to achieve desired outcomes.

We’ll be analyzing the company’s culture using NLP(Natural Language Processing) which will provide valuable insights into the organization’s beliefs and practices.

* **Data Collection:** We’ll be using the optimum dataset that contains the current and former employee’s reviews based on metrics such as work-balance, culture-values,career-opportunities etc.

* **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure consistency and eliminate noise. Perform tasks like removing irrelevant information, converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and handling special characters.

* **Tokenization:** Break down the preprocessed text into individual words or tokens. Tokenization helps in preparing the text for further analysis.

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Apply sentiment analysis techniques to determine the overall sentiment expressed in the text. Sentiment analysis can help identify positive, negative, or neutral sentiments associated with the company culture. We’ll be giving a sentiment score based upon the overall reviews.

* **Visualization:** We are utilizing various visualization techniques such as bar charts, pie charts and scatter plots to present the findings of the analysis in a visually appealing and informative manner.

* **Word Frequency Calculation:** Once the text data is preprocessed, you need to calculate the frequency of each word in the corpus. This involves counting the occurrence of each unique word in the text.

* **Word Cloud Generation:** After obtaining the word frequencies, you can use a word cloud library or implementation to generate the visual representation of the word cloud. The size or prominence of each word in the cloud is typically determined by its frequency in the text.

* **Interpretation and Insights:** Analyze the results of the NLP techniques applied and draw meaningful conclusions about the company culture. Look for patterns, trends, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement. Use the insights gained to make data-driven decisions for shaping or transforming the company culture.

**After the Interpretation the user can analyze the various aspects of company culture including:**
* Values and Beliefs followed inside the company
* Norms and behaviors
* Leadership and management styles
* Employee engagement and Satisfaction
* Inclusion and diversity
* Communication and Collaboration
* Organizational Structure and Processes
